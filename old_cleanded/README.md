# old_cleanded

Archived legacy files moved out of active development paths.

Main active paths are:
- `firmware/master_cpu`
- `firmware/input_cpu`
- `firmware/display_cpu`
- `shared/protocol`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `CODEX_TRUTH.md`
- `INPUT_OUTPUT_MAP.md`

This archive folder keeps historical references and old support material
without cluttering the primary code structure.
